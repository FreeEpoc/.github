## Hi there 👋

👩‍💻 This organization was created to fork the Symbian project. The starting point is the original EPL licensed Symbian from 07/12/2010  

🙋‍♀️ We intend to use artificial intelligence for documentation and all kinds of things that need to be clarified and developed.

🍿 This is even maybe a little unrealistically ambitious, so you're welcome to have fun!
