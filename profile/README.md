## FreeEpoc

👩‍💻 This organization was created to fork the Symbian project. The starting point is the original EPLv1.0 licensed Symbian as of 07/12/2010. All code is licensed under the EPLv1.0 unless an exception is required for some reason.

🙋‍♀️ We intend to use artificial intelligence for documentation and all kinds of things that need to be clarified and developed.

🍿 This is even maybe a little unrealistically ambitious, so you're welcome to have fun!


#### Why the name FreeEpoc?

The name of the project comes from the original [EPOC operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPOC_(operating_system)) name (on which [Symbian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbian) is based) and the common GNU/BSD world way of naming free source code projects, i.e. by adding the prefix "Free".

The name has Epoc and not EPOC because that was the original name (Epoc -> EPOC -> Symbian). Also, FreeEPOC would have been an ugly looking name for the project initiator, but that's just a matter of taste.

The name "FreeSymbian" would have been too questionable to use due to the trademarks associated with it.
